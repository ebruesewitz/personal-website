              <h4>Extroverted:</h4>
              <p>"I like getting my energy from active involvement in events and having a lot of different activities. I'm excited when I'm around people and I like to energize other people. I like moving into action and making things happen. I generally feel at home in the world. I often understand a problem better when I can talk out loud about it and hear what others have to say."</p>
              <br>
              <h4>Intuitive:</h4>
              <p>"I pay the most attention to impressions or the meaning and patterns of the information I get. I would rather learn by thinking a problem through than by hands-on experience. I'm interested in new things and what might be possible, so that I think more about the future than the past. I like to work with symbols or abstract theories, even if I don't know how I will use them. I remember events more as an impression of what it was like than as actual facts or details of what happened."</p>
              <br>
              <h4>Feeling:</h4>
              <p>"I believe I can make the best decisions by weighing what people care about and the points-of-view of persons involved in a situation. I am concerned with values and what is the best for the people involved. I like to do whatever will establish or maintain harmony. In my relationships, I appear caring, warm, and tactful."</p>
              <br>
              <h4>Perceiving:</h4>
              <p>"I use my perceiving function (whether it is Sensing or Intuition) in my outer life. To others, I seem to prefer a flexible and spontaneous way of life, and I like to understand and adapt to the world rather than organize it. Others see me staying open to new experiences and information."</p>

              <br>
              <p>"People who are innately good at influencing are always selling the team's ideas inside and outside the organization. When you need someone to take charge, speak up, and make sure your group is heard, look to someone with the strength to influence.""</p>
              <br>
              <h4>Communication:</h4>
              <p>"Communicators generally find it easy to put their thoughts into words. They are good conversationalists and presenters."</p>
              <br>
              <h4>Maximizer:</h4>
              <p>"Maximizers focus on strengths as a way to stimulate personal and group excellence. They seek to transform something strong into something superb."</p>
              <br>
              <h4>Futuristic:</h4>
              <p>"Futurists are inspired by the future and what could be. They inspire others with their visions of the future."</p>
              <br>
              <h4>Woo (Winning Others Over):</h4>
              <p>"People strong in the Woo theme love the challenge of meeting new people and winning them over. They derive satisfaction from breaking the ice and making a connection with another person."</p>
              <br>
              <h4>Inclusiveness/Includer:</h4>
              <p>"Includers are accepting of others. They show awareness of those who feel left out, and make an effort to include them."</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <br>
    <p>I'm currently in my third year out of five at the University of Cincinnati. One of the main reasons I chose to go to UC was because of their co-op program. By the time I graduate, I will have had 5 semesters of experience working full-time in my area of study.</p>
    <p>I studied Chemical Engineering for my first year at UC and did a co-op as a Chemical Engineer at L'Oreal in the fall of my sophomore year. It was a great experience (feel free to click back through my resume to learn more about it), but by the end of the semester I knew I wanted to switch my major. I switched into Computer Science the Spring of my Sophomore year at UC, and am confident I made the right decision in doing so. Classes I'm enjoying this semester include Algorithms and Database Design. Ask me about sorting algorithms--I could geek out about them for hours.</p>
