  <h2>Freshman Year In Review</h2>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Well, my first year of college is officially over. As I&#8217;m sitting in my empty dorm room waiting for my RA to pick up my keys, I can&#8217;t help but look back at my first year at UC and reflect on my experiences here. This year has brought growth in two major areas of my life. I&#8217;ll try my best to highlight them below.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Personal Growth:</strong></p>
    <p>This year was the first time I was truly independent and it terrified me. I was responsible for my own schedule, budget, eating and sleeping patterns. I wish I could say that I did an excellent job of managing these areas of my life, but the truth is I struggled with almost every one of them. It was hard learning how to budget my time between classes, jobs, friendships and other responsibilities. I quickly learned that watching Netflix for 4 hours a day was <em>not</em> going to be an acceptable use of my time. I learned that I had to go to bed at a reasonable time if I had any hope of making my 8 am&#8217;s the next morning, and that in order to get to bed at a decent time, I needed to budget my free time effectively. I&#8217;m the kind of person who loves to fill every spare minute of my day with some form of activity. However, this year taught me that sometimes the best thing I can do for myself and for others is to simply be available. I learned that others feel valued when I&#8217;m available to help them with a project that comes up, and I feel much less stressed when I allow time in my day for the unexpected.</p>
    <p>Living with a roommate also promoted growth in my communication skills&mdash;I learned that if you want someone to change a certain behavior, you have to graciously point it out to them. I learned how to talk through issues with a person rather than complain and gossip about them. And most importantly, I gained a new best friend.</p>
    <p>I also gained a deep love for the city of Cincinnati this school year. My friend Kaitlyn and I would go on &ldquo;Adventure Thursdays&rdquo; every week to explore new places around the city. We went to several coffee shops, restaurants, and museums. A few of my favorite places included the Macaron Bar in OTR, Mount Adams Lookout, Streetpops, Aglamesis Bros Ice Cream, the Contemporary Arts Center, and Union Terminal. I realized that if you&#8217;re willing to step outside of your comfort zone and try something new, you&#8217;ll appreciate your city and its history a lot more. </p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Professional Growth:</strong></p>
    <p>As an engineering student, I am required to participate in a co-op program starting my second year at the university. Because of this, I learned a lot about professionalism through my Intro to Co-op course my second semester. I learned how to build a resum&#233; that showcases my strengths as a professional. I learned that while I don&#8217;t have major-specific experience, I still have a lot of skills to offer a company; such as leadership and teamwork skills that I have built through leading Young Life and participating in other honors experiences. Once I gained confidence in myself as a professional, I quickly developed the communication skills necessary for interviews and career fairs. The career fair provided me with valuable information about different companies I could be co-oping for and gave me a better idea of what a chemical engineer might do after graduation. I also learned the importance of networking and was able to land a co-op at L&#8217;Oreal this fall because of the people I met at the career fair. I'm excited to start that co-op and learn more about applications of my degree. </p>
    <br>
    <p>In conclusion, I think the biggest lesson I&#8217;ll take away from this year is this:</p>
    <p><strong><em>Don&#8217;t be afraid to step outside of your comfort zone.</em></strong> It will cause you to grow in ways you didn&#8217;t think were possible and will teach you so much about yourself and the world around you. Sure, you might fail at first, but look at failures as a chance to learn and grow rather than a sign to quit.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Thanks for a great first year, UC. See you again in August.</p>
