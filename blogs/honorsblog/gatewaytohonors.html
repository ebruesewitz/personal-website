  <h2>Gateway to University Honors</h2>

    <p>This semester I took a class called Gateway to University Honors. The purpose of this class was to introduce new students to UC&#8217;s honors program and teach them how to meet its requirements. I took the class with about twenty other students in the honors program and was able to get to know each student in the class as we were divided into small groups to discuss different projects throughout the semester. I chose to engage in this experience not only because it is required of first year honors students, but also because I wanted to learn more about the honors program and how I can be sure I&#8217;m meeting all of its requirements. I also hoped to meet other honors students through this class. This experience met my expectations by showing me exactly what was expected of an honors student and how I can make sure to accomplish that. This experience was meaningful because it showed me how to reflect on situations and gave me a better understanding of the honors program and all it has to offer. It has prepared me for my next four years at UC by showing me how to document honors experiences and how to reflect on them. It helped me build on the friendships I had already made at the honors retreat as well as allowed me to create new friendships and reflection skills.</p>
