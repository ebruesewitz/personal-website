  <h2>English 2089</h2>

  <div class="content">
    <p>This summer, I took Honors ENGL2089. Intermediate Composition is a required class for all Computer Science students, which originally surprised me. I never thought of English as a skill that was critical for computer science students to learn&#8212;the most writing we&#8217;ll really need to do in the workplace is sending the occasional email, right? However, throughout the semester, English became my favorite class, and surprisingly was one of the classes that contributed the most to my growth as a professional in my field of study.</p>
    <p>I wrote two papers over the course of the semester: a 10&#8211;page literacy narrative and a 59&#8211;page discourse analysis. Even though both of these papers were quite lengthy, they didn&#8217;t feel like much work since I spent two hours a week writing in class. Every day of class I knew what to expect: the goals for the day were clearly laid out for us and writing prompts to help us organize our thoughts were listed in a presentation that the class completed together. The class was an extrovert&#8217;s dream&#8212;writing and reflecting with 20 other classmates. It kept me focused, motivated and proud of the progress I was making.</p>
    <p>This semester helped me to further develop my writing skills&#8212;my professor challenged me to think about my audience as I wrote the paper and encouraged me to change the voice of it accordingly. She challenged us to take an in&#8211;depth look to a literacy we developed, and analyzed how we developed it so we could learn how to better grow our literacies in the future. Since I had recently changed majors, it was especially helpful for me to take a look at how I best learn and adapt to new environments. My literacy narrative is a paper I&#8217;ll cherish for a while&#8212;not only did it help me learn more about myself, it also allowed me to write about something near to my heart. For that I am grateful.</p>
    <p>My discourse analysis is one of the things I am most proud of creating this year. It allowed me to take an in&#8211;depth look at web development&#8212;a field I was interested in but didn&#8217;t know much about. By the end of the semester, I thoroughly understood the ins and outs of web development and was able to take my knowledge and create a beautiful, functioning website. Writing this paper made me more confident when talking to other developers, as I now understand the concepts they&#8217;re talking about. I now feel more at ease in my new major and hope writing this paper will prepare me for interviews as I begin searching for co&#8211;ops in development.</p>
    <p>I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this class. It allowed me to express myself creatively while writing about things I loved. It gave me the opportunity to better understand myself and my field of study, and it taught me how to communicate my thoughts in a way that makes sense to my audience. This class was a great learning experience for me and it helped me realize my talent and passion for technical writing. I hope to continue to take more English classes in the future in order to further refine these skills.</p>
