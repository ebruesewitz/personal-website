  <h2>Sophomore Year In Review</h2>

  <div class="content">
    <p>My sophomore year of college can be summed up in three words: change, growth, and identity.</p>
    <p>As I started my second year at UC, I was met with a number of changes. The first major change came in August: moving off campus and into a house with 5 other girls. I couldn&#8217;t wait to move into a house with 5 of my best friends&#8212;to share life so intimately with one another and grow even closer together than we already were. I was excited to finally be able to plan and cook my own meals, and couldn&#8217;t wait to decorate my room exactly how I wanted. I spent hours saving pins to my <em>let&#8217;s | eat clean</em> and <em>let&#8217;s | go home</em> boards on Pinterest&#8212;I was determined to do everything in my power to make my life look as perfect as the carefully edited pictures on my boards did. However, after a year of living in a house with 5 other girls, I can tell you there&#8217;s a lot more behind those picture perfect Pinterest boards I eagerly created. There are fights, and tears, and joy, and pain, and dirty dishes in the sink, but most of all, there&#8217;s growth. Living so closely with 5 other people has pushed me tremendously this year&#8212;it has taught me how to effectively handle conflict, how to serve others, and how to listen well. Throughout the year, a repeated offender in conflicts has been the never&#8211;ending pile of dirty dishes in our kitchen sink. It&#8217;s amazing how much we fight over that pile of dishes. But, throughout the year, I&#8217;ve watched the way we handle conflicts over the cleanliness of our house, respecting each other&#8217;s space, our guest policies, and hurt feelings begin to change. At the start of the year, I was not a very confrontational person. If one of my housemates was doing something that bothered me, I chose not to address my frustrations with her, but rather buried them inside. I used to think the best way to handle conflicts was to pretend they didn&#8217;t exist, but I&#8217;ve come to realize that when I do this, I only end up distancing myself from my friends due to my frustrations. Now, our house handles conflict by talking to one another directly. We actively fight against things like gossip, which threaten to tear our house apart, and we work together to push each other closer to honesty and forgiveness. Now, when I see a pile of dirty dishes in the sink, I take the time to wash them for my housemates&#8212;not because I have to, but because I want to serve my housemates in that way. I take the time to listen to how my housemates are doing, knowing that I will have more grace for them if I know how hard their weeks have been. As this year comes to a close and I prepare to move to a house with even more girls next year, I am grateful for this year with my 5 best friends. Things haven&#8217;t always been easy, but we have grown so much together and I have learned that friendship is something worth fighting for.</p>
    <p>The next big change I faced this year started at the end of August: my first semester co&#8211;oping in the Warehouse Department of a L&#8217;Oreal Manufacturing plant. Working for L&#8217;Oreal was my dream job. I loved the idea of working in a fast&#8211;paced environment, and the fact that they made some of my favorite products made the co&#8211;op that much sweeter. My semester at L&#8217;Oreal contributed the most to my personal and professional growth&#8212;it challenged and pushed me and forced me outside of my comfort zone, and I loved it. I was put in a unique position as a first time co&#8211;op: due to changes of management in my department, I was the only &#8220;supervisor&#8221; in my building for most of the semester. I was in a different building from the director of the department, who, because of all the transitions, was rarely in her office anyways. This was hard for me at first, because I wasn&#8217;t familiar with the plant and was unsure of who to go to for help when I had questions. However, as time progressed, I realized how much of an advantage I had as a co&#8211;op in this position. Being in a different building from my manager forced me to introduce myself to as many employees as possible. It forced me to step out of my comfort zone and ask others for help, even if I&#8217;d never met them before. It forced me to learn how to be independent, manage my own schedule and projects, and keep track of my progress on each of the projects assigned to me. When I ran out of things to do, I took advantage of the time to introduce myself to the warehouse employees, look for ways to improve the plant, and shadow other departments. By the end of my co&#8211;op, I had a very good understanding of the culture of the company, each department&#8217;s role in it, and what the role of a chemical engineer was within a manufacturing plant. I learned to effectively manage my own time and projects, to reach out and ask for help if I don&#8217;t understand something, to build relationships with any and everyone, to be confident in my work and to speak up if I saw an opportunity for growth. By the end of the semester, I was excited to continue to grow as young professional, and couldn&#8217;t wait to graduate and enter the work force for good. However, while I loved the culture at L&#8217;Oreal, my experience there helped me realize I didn&#8217;t want to pursue a career in chemical engineering.</p>
    <p>This realization led me to my final large change this year: changing my major. I went into winter break knowing I wanted to switch majors, but having no idea what major I wanted to switch into. I knew I was passionate about small businesses and startups, innovation, creativity, and change. I wanted a major that would allow me to have more creative freedom, in a field that was constantly changing. I love learning about new things, so I wanted a major where there would constantly be more to discover. I spent my time researching local business, and fell in love with the tech startups in Cincinnati. I talked to my uncle, who is a web developer, and learned more about computer science from him. After talking to several computer science professionals and doing a little bit of programming in my free time, I was hooked. I loved that I could take my ideas and make them a reality using a computer program. I loved that there are always new languages and technologies to learn, and that the major has endless applications. So, this spring, I officially made the switch into computer science. It hasn&#8217;t been an easy switch&#8212;technology is new to me, and I&#8217;ve had to take a lot of time outside of class to research concepts that I don&#8217;t understand. But, I&#8217;ve loved every minute of it. I&#8217;ve loved talking to tech companies in Cincinnati and dreaming up my own ideas of what the future of technology might look like. This summer, I&#8217;m continuing to take computer science classes, and in the fall I will begin yet another change: my first co&#8211;op in my new major.</p>
    <p>This semester has brought many changes, but I&#8217;m realizing that life is constantly changing. While change isn&#8217;t always comfortable, it&#8217;s the fastest way to bring about growth. I have grown professionally through my co&#8211;op experiences, and have grown personally through living in a house with 5 other girls. Each of these changes has played a part in shaping my identity. Living with others has made me much better at dealing with conflict, and has shown me that sometimes I like to be alone to rest and recharge. As an extrovert, that was a huge lesson for me to learn&#8212;that it&#8217;s okay to say no to some things and take some time to myself. My co&#8211;op has shaped changed me from a girl who works because she has to to a young professional who works because she wants to. It has made me much more independent and better at interacting with adults who are older than me. Finally, changing my major has shaped my identity by making me someone who is passionate and excited about the work she&#8217;s doing. I love my classes and spend time learning more about my major outside of school. I can&#8217;t wait to see what growth the changes in the upcoming school year bring about.</p>
    <p>Thanks for another great year, UC. It&#8217;s a good day to be a Bearcat.</p>
