    <h2>Matlab Weather Project</h2>

      <p>For my honors experience this year, I chose to take part in the engineering honors MATLAB experience. For this project, we were placed in teams of four engineering students from various majors and were under the direction of one of the engineering professors. This was the first semester this experience was offered, so we got a lot of creative freedom with the project. I met with my team and the professor once a week over the course of the semester, and we worked to explore a real-world problem using the skills we had learned in our MATLAB classes. My team decided to explore weather patterns over the years to see if we could spot any trends that pointed to global climate change.</p>
      <p>The team started out with the idea to model climate changes across the entire world, but we quickly discovered that there was not a lot of consistent weather data available outside of the US. So, we narrowed our focus to the United States instead, each taking a different section of the US to explore and different data to investigate with the hopes of incorporating it all into one cohesive program at the end of the semester.</p>
      <p>The part of the project that I decided to focus on plotted the average high and low temperatures for each year from 1980 to the present. I also calculated the top 10% and bottom 10% of the range of temperatures each year and made a bar graph of the number of times the daily temperature fell in this range. This was to determine whether or not there were a lot of extremes each year. If the number of times the temperature fell in the top 10% grew, then it could be assumed that global warming was plausible. However, this did not happen and both the plots stayed fairly consistent. The plots of highs and lows over the years also fluctuated but did not increase, again contradicting what I expected to see in a graph supporting global warming. One of the challenges that I faced during my portion of the project was how to make the script as short as possible so that I didn&#8217;t have to add a new section for every new state I wanted to look at. I was able to do that by creating a giant menu statement at the start of the file where I loaded each file and stored data under generic variable names that were used later in the script. This made the script much less lengthy and allowed it to run faster and more efficiently.</p>
      <p>I was also resposible for putting everyone&#8217;s portion of the project together at the end of the semester. This was a much more difficult task than I had originally anticipated. Since each person chose to take a look at different aspects of the data, they each had a little different way of taking in and storing the information. I had to go through each person&#8217;s script and change several parts of it in order to get it to work as one cohesive unit. Even after I was finished, there were still a few graphs of one of my teammate&#8217;s sections that I simply couldn&#8217;t get to display the way she wanted. I learned the importance of being on the same page as far as what data and variable names you want to work with to avoid difficulties combining scripts later.</p>
      <p>This project taught me a lot about how to work with a team on projects. The final script that we worked on was very long, and would have been impossible to complete efficiently if I had created it by myself. I met with my team and Dr. Ossman weekly in order to update each other on our progress as well as ask each other and Dr. Ossman for help if we had trouble getting our portion of the script to run correctly. At first, our team was planning on trying to model biological processes, however, we quickly realized that we did not posses a thorough enough understanding that was needed to write such an intricate code. We agreed to model weather as a team, which still had its difficulties. At first, we wanted to model weather patterns across the globe. But after dividing different areas among out team members, we realized there wasn&#8217;t much weather data that we could access except for in the US. This experience taught me that it&#8217;s important to be flexible and willing to constantly adapt a project depending on the information available to you and required results. I also learned the importance of meeting with a team to work outside of designated meeting and presentation times in order to ensure you are all on the same page and understand what the other team members are doing. Overall, this project was very helpful and gave me a much better understanding of MATLAB as well as necessary skills for effective teamwork.</p>
