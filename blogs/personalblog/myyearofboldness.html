  <h2>My Year of Boldness</h2>

    <p>I suck at New Years Resolutions. They sound really great in theory, but I usually set resolutions that are way too ambitious and end up getting frustrated when I can&#8217;t keep them. Last year I decided that instead of a resolution, I would pick a theme that I wanted my year to be defined by. 2016 was the &quot;Year of Boldness&quot;&#8212;the year of taking risks and saying yes to the things that scared me. As I was reflecting on the past year, I realized my &quot;Year of Boldness&quot; could basically be summarized as taking my <em>&quot;what ifs&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;I&#8217;ll nevers&quot;</em> and asking a simple question of them: <em><strong>&quot;Why not?&quot;</strong></em></p>

    <p>&quot;Hey Taylor, what if we left for a road trip to New York City right now?&quot;</p>

    <p><em><strong>Why not?</strong></em></p>

    <p>&quot;I&#8217;ll never run a half marathon.&quot;</p>

    <p><em><strong>Why not?</strong></em></p>

    <p>&quot;What if I switched my major?&quot;</p>

    <p><em><strong>Why not?</strong></em></p>

    <p>As I asked myself these questions and began to take risks, I realized that my <em>&quot;what ifs&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;I&#8217;ll nevers&quot;</em> were holding me back from a life of adventurous living. I realized that I&#8217;m capable of <em>way</em> more than I give myself credit for. And I realized, as clich&#233; as this sounds, taking risks really <em>does</em> lead to great reward.</p>

    <p>My favorite &quot;<em>what if</em>&quot; of 2016 was taking a spontaneous trip to New York City with my friend, Taylor. It was the last few weeks of summer before classes started. Our summer jobs had ended, so we had some time to kill. One afternoon while we were grabbing lunch together, Taylor looked at me and said, &quot;What if we just took a road trip or something?&quot; I laughed and said, &quot;Sure, let&#8217;s just hop in the car and drive to New York.&quot; Before I knew it, our joking turned into Taylor calling her cousins who lived in Long Island to see if we could stay with them while I frantically scoured the internet for the cheapest tickets I could find to get us there. That night, we boarded the Chinese bus to NYC, which was an adventure all by itself. The bus smelled like fish, the driver didn&#8217;t speak English, and I swear we stopped at every Chinese restaurant from Cincinnati to Columbus. However, we arrived in NYC in the morning exhausted but fueled by the excitement of being in the city. We packed as much as we could into the 3 days that we were there. We walked the Brooklyn Bridge and the High Line, we visited the Met and the Rockefeller Center and Times Square, we walked through Central Park and visited Wall Street and Chelsea Market. And we drank lots of coffee to keep ourselves awake for all of it. I LOVE NEW YORK. Seriously. I am so glad I took the opportunity to go there when I had the chance. It&#8217;s a weekend I&#8217;ll always think fondly of.</p>

    <p>The <em>&quot;I&#8217;ll never&quot;</em> that taught me that I&#8217;m capable of way more than I give myself credit for was running the Flying Pig Half Marathon. It was three weeks until the Flying Pig, and I was really regretting not signing up to run it. I had always thought the idea of running a half marathon was really cool, but I could never commit to actually training for it. So, I did what any normal person would do in my shoes&#8212;I signed up to run the Flying Pig anyways. I three short weeks I went from running 0 miles a week to running 13.1 miles at an average pace of about 10 minutes per mile, which is actually a decent time for a girl. Crossing the finish line of the Flying Pig Half Marathon was the most exhilarating thing I&#8217;ve ever experienced. I felt so proud of myself, so accomplished and convinced I could do anything I put my mind to. I loved running it so much that I signed up to run the full marathon this year. Come cheer me on if you&#8217;re in the area!</p>

    <p>My first and hardest <em>&quot;what if&quot;</em> of 2016 was switching my major to Computer Science. Changing my major was a scary decision for me to make, because there was so much uncertainty in it. I was scared that I wouldn&#8217;t like my major or I wouldn&#8217;t be able to find a job since I was so far behind. Switching into Computer Science has definitely been a hard transition to make, and a lot of times I feel completely incompetent and like an imposter in my major. But, I&#8217;m working for my dream company right now and I&#8217;ve discovered a lot of things I love due to changing my major, so I guess the switch is working for me so far.</p>

    <p>I have countless other stories just like these, and even though 2016 is over, I still practice challenging my <em>&quot;what ifs&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;I&#8217;ll nevers&quot;</em> with <em>&quot;Why nots&quot;</em>. It&#8217;s because of all of my experiences over the last year that I can assure you that taking risks and saying yes to the things that scare you is worth it. For those of you who are skeptical, or are thinking <em>&quot;That&#8217;s great for her, but I&#8217;ll never do something like that&quot;</em>, I want to challenge you with a question:</p>

    <p><strong><em>Why not?</em></strong></p>
