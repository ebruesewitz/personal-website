  <h2>New Year New Me</h2>

    <p>I have mixed feelings about the traditions surrounding New Years. I love the idea of a fresh start, a blank slate, moving forward from past regrets and mistakes. It seems fitting that the New Year is often accompanied with freshly fallen snow covering the ground, symbolic of burying the past and looking forward to the future we get to begin writing for ourselves. The New Year comes with a variety of well&#8211;intended promises &#8212; &quot;New Year, new me&quot; must have been the caption on at least 20 of my friends&#8217; Instagram posts this year. <em>This year is <strong>my</strong> year</em>, we think. <em>This is the year when I finally get my life together. I&#8217;ll work harder, I&#8217;ll be healthier, I&#8217;ll be more organized, I&#8217;ll be less busy, I&#8217;ll be a better friend, I&#8217;ll be fully present, I&#8217;ll finally learn to say no to things, I&#8217;ll...</em></p>
    <p>The list goes on and on. New Years Resolutions are hard for me because it&#8217;s tough for me to pick just one thing to focus on when clearly every area of my life could use some work. I should be more organized, I should be better about sticking to a budget, I should spend more time with the people I love, doing the things that I love. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s only so much time in the day, and if you&#8217;re anything like me, my well&#8211;meaning list of resolutions quickly grows into a novel of unrealistic expectations. I look at the women who I admire most and wonder how on earth their lives seem so completely together. Instead of taking the time to praise God for how he uniquely creates and works inside of each one of them, I find myself comparing myself to those women, jotting down all the ways I don&#8217;t measure up.</p>
    <p>So, while I love the idea of a new year with a fresh start, the New Year tends to come with the baggage of a whole lot of unrealistic expectations I&#8217;ve set for myself. Expectations I know I&#8217;ll never <em>really</em> live up to, but hey, if I make progress on them, that has to count for something, right? </p>
    <p>This year, I&#8217;m starting out differently. 2016 was a really hard year for me, and honestly, I&#8217;m glad to see it go. I&#8217;m excited to walk into what 2017 has for me. If it&#8217;s more hardship and heartache, I hope I lean into it with more grace and joy than I did last year. But I sure hope this year is a year of life and joy. Instead of keeping a list of resolutions, I tend to pick a theme I hope to live out during the New Year. Last year was the &quot;Year of Boldness&quot; and the &quot;Year of Yes&quot;&#8212;leaning into the things that scared me and taking risks in hopes of a greater reward. That was good for me. It caused me to grow a lot professionally, discover new passions, and made me realize that I&#8217;m capable of a lot when I don&#8217;t let fear hold me back. 2016 was also the &quot;Year of the Dreamer&quot;. It was the year I learned to take my dreams for the future seriously&#8212;I prayed over them, researched them, shared them, and pursued them. All of last year&#8217;s themes were good themes, themes that are now so engrained in me that I think I&#8217;ll always make a habit of practicing them.</p>
    <p>But, with a new year comes new themes so here mine are: 2017 is the &quot;Year of Redemption&quot; from past regrets and shame, from living a mundane life of wallowing in self&#8211;pity and comparison. Redemption from neglected friendships, and most importantly the redemption of my soul through the pursuit of things that bring me life and joy. 2017 is also the &quot;Year of Progress, not Perfection&quot; and the &quot;Year of Awe and Wonder&quot;. Of learning to be fully present in the here and now and not take one moment for granted. I wasted too much of 2016 tending to my image, making sure that I portrayed the best version of myself to others. This year, I want to commit to soaking up every day for all it&#8217;s worth&#8212;the good, the bad, the mundane&#8212;everything. Because it&#8217;s moments like these that count&#8212;sitting by the fire sipping on some mulled cider while my brother plays the banjo&#8212;these are the memories I&#8217;ll cherish forever, the ones that make me who I am today. This year, I want to greet each day with a sense of awe and wonder, embracing it for what it is instead of trying to bend and squeeze it and myself into my tiny image of how things &quot;ought to be&quot;. I want to embrace myself for who I am too&#8212;not wishing I looked different, was more creative, more athletic, healthier or smarter. I refuse to crush myself with such unrealistic expectations. I am who I am, and I am proud of the woman I am today. Yes, of course I&#8217;m not perfect, but I&#8217;ve certainly made a lot of progress. There are plenty of aspects in my life that could use some growth, but I&#8217;ve fought a lot of battles to become who I am today. It&#8217;s time I start celebrating that.</p>
