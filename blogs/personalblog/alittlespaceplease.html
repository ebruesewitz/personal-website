    <h2>A Little Space Please</h2>

    <div class="mainimg"><img src="../../images/space.jpg" alt="Cup of tea in a bed"></div>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Stop. Just for a second. And breathe.</p>
      <p>When is the last time you've set aside time to rest?</p>
      <p>.</p>
      <p>.</p>
      <p>.</p>
      <p>Binge watching Netflix doesn&#8217;t count.</p>
      <p>.</p>
      <p>.</p>
      <p>.</p>
      <p>Refreshing Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram for the 50th time today doesn&#8217;t count either.</p>
      <p>When is the last time you&#8217;ve given yourself permission to simply sit and think? To do something that you truly enjoy without worrying about whether or not it&#8217;s the most productive use of your time?</p>
      <p>If you would&#8217;ve asked me this question a month ago my answer would&#8217;ve been "probably never". Society has a way of making us feel guilty if we&#8217;re not always doing something. Busy is the new normal, and I bought right into that standard.</p>
      <p>I thought the only way to be successful was to fill my schedule until I couldn&#8217;t possibly do any more, and once it was full, I would fill it up even more. I lived every day feeling over scheduled, over stressed, and over tired, but I thought that was just a part of growing up. Life waits for no one, so we just have to suck it up and accept it right?</p>
      <br>
      <p><em><strong>wrong.</strong></em></p>
      <p>The problem with living life this way is we really can&#8217;t pursue excellence in anything we are doing. I couldn&#8217;t truly be invested in the moment because I was always worried about what was coming next. My work was rushed at best and I was sacrificing quality of experiences for quantity.</p>
      <p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love having a busy schedule&mdash;I feel most productive when I have a lot on my plate. But, what I&#8217;ve been learning recently is while a full schedule is great for productivity, there is also merit in creating space. Invariably, a project will take longer than you think it&#8217;s going to, a friend will call you needing help with their latest crisis, or your dinner guests will stay way later than you expected. Creating space in my daily schedule means planning for the unexpected and giving myself permission to stray from the plan every once in a while. Creating space allows me to stay longer at brunch with my mom, drive my housemate to class in the pouring rain, or take on that extra project at work that my manager can&#8217;t finish on her own.</p>
      <p>Most importantly, creating space allows me time for rest. Real rest&mdash;not mindless entertainment. Rest in the form of creative time with no agenda&mdash;time to work on something, <em>anything</em>, that I want without feeling like I have to accomplish something completely revolutionary and world&ndash;changing. Rest for me looks like creating this website. It looks like taking online classes in graphic design and photography just for fun. It looks like painting and practicing calligraphy. It looks like mastering a new yoga pose or learning how to play a new song on guitar. It looks like driving around the city, singing with my windows rolled down or going on a long run in the pouring rain. I give myself permission to do whatever I want during those pockets of free time. It is good and it is entirely my own. In these pockets of space, I have learned who I am and who I want to be. I have learned to embrace my passions and dreams and aspirations and to not apologize when they&#8217;re different from those of my friends. </p>
      <p>During this season where I feel like I&#8217;m sprinting from one activity to the next, I&#8217;m learning to find joy in the space, for I have grown there. In the midst of juggling classes, an internship, leading at Withrow, and learning to serve my family and housemates, I&#8217;m at peace. And I feel more productive and creative than I ever have before.</p>
      <p>Maybe busy is my new normal. But it doesn&#8217;t mean I have to let it define me.</p>
