    <h2>To The Dreamer</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <p>I am a big supporter of dreams. </p>
      <p>I believe each of us is created with unique dreams and passions, and that&#8217;s what makes our culture work. We each have different aspirations for the future. Different ideas of success. Different approaches to life.</p>
      <p><em>Yet, somewhere along the way, we lose sight of these dreams.</em></p>
      <p>We let others take hold of our dreams and mold them to fit their own ideas of success. It happens so often, so gradually, that we don&#8217;t even realize it.</p>
      <p>We don&#8217;t realize that the people who care about us are the ones doing it to us. We don&#8217;t realize that we&#8217;re doing it to the people we care about too.</p>
      <p>We let people tell us our dreams will never amount to anything. And we start to believe them.</p>
      <p>So we dismiss these dreams, writing them off as childish fantasies that will never grow into anything. And we find ourselves working toward a stable career at a Fortune 500 company because that&#8217;s what makes sense. It makes sense. And it&#8217;s comfortable. Yet, it feels empty. Incomplete. There has to be something more than this, right? More than the next big project. More than another promotion. More than the next paycheck we&#8217;ve worked so hard to earn.</p>
      <p>See, that&#8217;s the problem with ignoring our dreams&mdash;they still come back to haunt us. We may not remember exactly what they were, but we know they existed. And deep down, we still long to make them a reality.</p>
      <p><strong><em>What are your dreams?</em></strong></p>
      <p>The ones you&#8217;ve lost sight of&mdash;the ones that seemed so crazy they could never be more than a fantasy.</p>
      <p>Have you ever stopped to consider that maybe they <em>could</em> be reality?</p>
      <p>What if we used our skills and worked together to make each other&#8217;s dreams reality? If we surrounded ourselves with people who nurtured our dreams and dreamt with us then maybe, just maybe, we could make something real out of them.</p>
      <p>After all, that&#8217;s how true innovation begins: <em>with a dream.</em></p>
      <p>Companies like Google, Apple, Windows and Facebook all started with a dream. And that dream, when put into the right hands, is a very powerful thing. It can lead to change. To new ideas. To growth.</p>
      <p>I encourage you to seriously consider your dreams: What would life look like if you fulfilled them? What is holding you back from achieving them? What steps can you take to reach them?</p>
      <p>Maybe along the way youll find that the reality of your dream isn&#8217;t as spectacular as you thought it would be. That&#8217;s okay. Some dreams are meant to stay that way.</p>
      <p>Just never stop dreaming.</p>
