      <p>Welcome! As you probably already know by now, my name is Elisabeth. I'm 20 years old and am studying Computer Science at the University of Cincinnati (Class of 2019). I'm passionate about small businesses, coffee, and photography, and I could talk music with you for hours. My main purpose in creating this website was to learn how to build a one from the ground up. But now that I'm done with it, I figured I might as well put it to use! This website will serve as a home base for all my projects, reflections, and contact information as I continue to work towards my degree. This website is something I've become quite proud of, so thank you for taking the time to visit it. This website is one of the most tangible things I have to show you who I am. It's a place where I get to be creative as I design it, expressive as I write it, and logical as I build it. Here, I'm able to see how all of my different passions fit together. It excites me because it reminds me of who I am-that I have value and worth and something unique to offer as a creative, extroverted computer scientist.</p>

      <p>So, why <em>did</em> I choose to major in computer science? I started college sure I would graduate as a chemical engineer. However, during my first semester in engineering, I was required to take a basic programming class. I was hooked. This was my first real exposure to coding, and it surprised me. I always thought that computer science was something that was for geeks who came out of the womb coding, but the more I talk to professionals in technology the more I realize this isn't always the case.</p>
      <p>Okay, let's face it--we all <em>are</em> pretty geeky. But, not all of us have been programming since we were 11. I love programming because it's something that allows me to take my ideas and work towards making them a reality. It allows me to express myself creatively when my artistic talent falls short. It promotes collaboration and growth and always presents a new challenge. Technology is constantly advancing, and as a professional computer science, there will always be something new and exciting for me to explore.</p>

      <p>My only regret since switching into a career in technology is I wish I would have been exposed to it sooner. In school we were required to take foreign language and fine arts classes as electives, but computer science classes were rare and, when they were offered, weren't promoted as useful skills to learn. Since the speed at which technology advances is continuing to grow, I believe it is critical we start educating our youth about technology. As a woman in computer science, I hope to encourage girls to consider pursuing careers in technology. I'm passionate about explaining computer science to the next generation in a way that isn't intimidating or boring in the hopes of showing them just how exciting it can be.</p>

      <p>Thanks again for taking the time to get to know a little more about me. I hope you enjoyed reading about a few of the things that get me excited about this major. If you'd like to learn more about me, head over to my blog (link up top) where I'll write about all the new lessons life has taught me lately.</p>
