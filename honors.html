        <h2><a href="blogs/honorsblog/sophomoreyearinreview.html">Sophomore Year in Review</a></h2>
        <p>My sophomore year of college can be summed up in three words: change, growth, and identity.</p>
        <p>As I started my second year at UC, I was met with a number of changes. The first major change came in August: moving off campus and into a house with 5 other girls.</p>
        <br>

        <h2><a href="blogs/honorsblog/english2089.html">English 2089</a></h2>
        <p>This summer, I took Honors ENGL2089. Intermediate Composition is a required class for all Computer Science students, which originally surprised me. I never thought of English as a skill that was critical for computer science students to learn&#8212;the most writing we&#8217;ll really need to do in the workplace is sending the occasional email, right?</p>
        <br>

        <h2><a href="blogs/honorsblog/freshmanyearinreview.html">Freshman Year In Review</a></h2>
        <p>Well, my first year of college is officially over. As I&#8217;m sitting in my empty dorm room waiting for my RA to pick up my keys, I can&#8217;t help but look back at my first year at UC and reflect on my experiences here. This year has brought growth in two major areas of my life. I&#8217;ll try my best to highlight them below.</p>
        <br>

        <h2><a href="blogs/honorsblog/matlabweatherproject.html">Matlab Weather Project</a></h2>
        <p>For my honors experience this year, I chose to take part in the engineering honors MATLAB experience. For this project, we were placed in teams of four engineering students from various majors and were under the direction of one of the engineering professors.</p>
        <br>

        <h2><a href="blogs/honorsblog/gatewaytohonors.html">Gateway to University Honors</a></h2>
        <p>This semester I took a class called Gateway to University Honors. The purpose of this class was to introduce new students to UC&#8217;s honors program and teach them how to meet its requirements. I took the class with about twenty other students in the honors program and was able to get to know each student in the class as we were divided into small groups to discuss different projects throughout the semester.</p>
